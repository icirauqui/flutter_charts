# Custom Charts Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Custom Charts repository! This project aims to provide a collection of custom chart implementations for various data visualization needs. Whether you're looking to create detailed bar charts, line charts, or more complex visualizations, this repository will eventually offer a wide range of tools to help you.

## Available Charts

### 1. Bar Charts
The first chart type implemented in this repository is the bar chart. Our custom bar chart implementation allows you to visualize categorical data efficiently. It comes with features such as:

- Customizable colors
- Adjustable bar spacing
- Support for horizontal and vertical orientations

## Future Development

We plan to expand this repository by developing additional chart types, including:

- **Line Charts:** Ideal for tracking changes over time or comparing multiple data series.
- **Pie Charts:** Useful for representing proportions and percentage breakdowns within a dataset.
- **Scatter Plots:** Great for identifying correlations and trends between two variables.
- **Histograms:** Perfect for visualizing the distribution of a dataset.
- **Heatmaps:** Useful for displaying data density and relationships in a grid format.

1. Clone the repository:
